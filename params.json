{"name":"My CCEx","tagline":"Install my own curationexchange.org","body":"Curation Cost Exchange\r\n====\r\n\r\nThis is the development page of the curationexchange.org platform, specifically the curation cost comparison tool, which allows you to submit and compare your costs with others.\r\n\r\n[**www.curationexchange.org**](http://www.curationexchange.org/) is a site that allows you to *understand what you and others are and should be spending in digital curation*. It is based on [Joomla!](http://www.joomla.org/) and is implemented by a theme and a component that implements the interactive part of the site, the cost comparison tool.\r\n\r\nYou can install your own version of the www.curationexchange.org and allow your institution and partners to submit and share curation costs.\r\n\r\n## Installation guide\r\n\r\nThe CCEx tool is implemented by a template (**ccex_template**) and a component (**com_ccex**), both with a simple and straight forward installation, very similar with other Joomla 3rd party components.\r\n\r\n### Requirements\r\n\r\nFor the correct operation of the CCEx tool, is recommended the following environment.\r\n* **Joomla! 3.3**: version 3.3.1 or greater (>= 3.3.6 recommended)\r\n* **PHP**: version 5.3.1 or greater (>= 5.3.1 recommended)\r\n* **MySQL**: version 5.1 or greater (>= 5.5.4 recommended)\r\n\r\n*Please note that, although the CCEx can work with different version, it was only tested in the versions recommended above.* \r\n\r\n### Download\r\n\r\nDownload the latest version:\r\n\r\n| Version | Size   | SHA1                                                    | Download             |\r\n|---------|--------|---------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|\r\n| v1.0.1  | 7.3 MB<br>0.2 MB | <sub>e6b10d8c2893533e6173633519fc618069bbd263</sub><br><sub>ffc89ae3ffcb74eedaf9ef1ba6bdec13699f91a6</sub> |[template](https://github.com/4cproject/ccex/releases/download/v1.0.1/ccex_template.zip)<br>[component](https://github.com/4cproject/ccex/releases/download/v1.0.1/com_ccex.zip)|\r\n\r\n### Installing\r\nInstalling comprises two steps: installing the CCEx template and installing the CCEx component.\r\n\r\n#### 1. Installing the CCEx template\r\n\r\n**1.1. Install via Admin Panel**\r\n\r\nOnce you have the template downloaded on your computer, login to the administrative area of your Joomla website and upload the template `ccex_template.zip` through `Extensions > Extension Manager > Upload Package File`.\r\n\r\n**1.2. Verify installation**\r\n\r\nGo to `Extension Manager > Manage` and search for `CCEx Template`. If the template appears on the list it is properly installed. \r\n\r\n**1.3. Change default Joomla template**\r\n\r\nNow you need to make it default for your website so your pages get the new design. Go to `Extensions > Template Manager`, where you will see a list of the installed templates available for your site and the administrative area,  locate the `CCExTemplate` and click on the star icon next to it.\r\n\r\n####2.
