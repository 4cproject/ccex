Curation Cost Exchange
====

This is the development page of the curationexchange.org platform, specifically the curation cost comparison tool, which allows you to submit and compare your costs with others.

[**www.curationexchange.org**](http://www.curationexchange.org/) is a site that allows you to *understand what you and others are and should be spending in digital curation*. It is based on [Joomla!](http://www.joomla.org/) and is implemented by a theme and a component that implements the interactive part of the site, the cost comparison tool.

You can install your own version of the www.curationexchange.org and allow your institution and partners to submit and share curation costs.

## How to install and use

The CCEx tool is implemented by a template (**ccex_template**) and a component (**com_ccex**), both with a simple and straight forward installation, very similar with other Joomla 3rd party components.

### Requirements

For the correct operation of the CCEx tool, is recommended the following environment.
* **Joomla! 3.3**: version 3.3.1 or greater (>= 3.3.6 recommended)
* **PHP 5**: version 5.3.1 or greater (>= 5.3.1 recommended)
* **MySQL 5**: version 5.1 or greater (>= 5.5.4 recommended)

*Please note that, although the CCEx can work with different version, it was only tested in the versions recommended above.*

### Install instructions
Installing comprises two steps: installing the CCEx template and installing the CCEx component.

Installing the CCEx template **ccex_template.zip**:

 1. **Install template:** Login to the administrative area of your Joomla website and upload the template through `Extensions > Extension Manager > Upload Package File`.

 2. **Verify installation:** Go to `Extension Manager > Manage` and search for "CCEx Template". If the template appears on the list then it is properly installed. 

 3. **Change default Joomla template:** Now you need to make it default for your website so your pages get the new design. Go to `Extensions > Template Manager` and locate the "CCExTemplate". Click on the :star: star icon next to it.  

Installing the CCEx component:

### Troubleshooting

**Error installing template: Copy failed**
When changing the template via the administrator and then installing a new version of the template the error message `Copy failed` might appear. You will need to undo the changes done to the template or uninstall the previous version of the template prior to installing the new one.
