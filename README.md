Curation Cost Exchange
====

This is the development page of the curationexchange.org platform, specifically the curation cost comparison tool, which allows you to submit and compare your costs with others.

[**www.curationexchange.org**](http://www.curationexchange.org/) is a site that allows you to *understand what you and others are and should be spending in digital curation*. It is based on [Joomla!](http://www.joomla.org/) and is implemented by a theme and a component that implements the interactive part of the site, the cost comparison tool.

You can install your own version of the www.curationexchange.org and allow your institution and partners to submit and share curation costs.

## How to install and use

The CCEx tool is implemented by a template (**ccex_template**) and a component (**com_ccex**), both with a simple and straight forward installation, very similar with other Joomla 3rd party components.

### Requirements

For the correct operation of the CCEx tool, is recommended the following environment.
* **Joomla! 3.3**: version 3.3.1 or greater (>= 3.3.6 recommended)
* **PHP 5**: version 5.3.1 or greater (>= 5.3.1 recommended)
* **MySQL 5**: version 5.1 or greater (>= 5.5.4 recommended)

*Please note that, although the CCEx can work with different version, it was only tested in the versions recommended above.*

### Install instructions
Installing comprises two steps: installing the CCEx template and installing the CCEx component.

Installing the CCEx template **ccex_template.zip**:

 1. **Install template:** Login to the administrative area of your Joomla website and upload the template through `Extensions > Extension Manager > Upload Package File`.

 2. **Verify installation:** Go to `Extension Manager > Manage` and search for "CCEx Template". If the template appears on the list then it is properly installed.

 3. **Change default Joomla template:** Now you need to make it default for your website so your pages get the new design. Go to `Extensions > Template Manager` and locate the "CCExTemplate". Click on the :star: star icon next to it.  

Installing the CCEx component  **com_ccex.zip**:

1. **Install component:** Login to the administrative area of your Joomla website and upload the component through `Extensions > Extension Manager > Upload Package File`.

2. **Add "Curation costs" to menu:**  Click on  `Menus > Main Menu > Add New Menu Item` in the administration menu on top. Set *Menu Title* as "Curation costs" and select the *Menu Item Type* as `Curation Cost Exchange > Compare Costs`. Click `Save & Close` to save and be redirected to *Menu Items*' page where you can reorder all the menu items.

3. **Add "Administration" menu:** Click on  `Menus > Main Menu > Add New Menu Item` in the administration menu on top. Set *Menu Title* as "Administration" and select the *Menu Item Type* as `Curation Cost Exchange > Administration`. Set Access to `Super Users` and click `Save`.

4. **Add profile menu:** Click on `Menus > Main Menu > Add New Menu Item` in the administration menu on top. Set *Menu Title* as "Profile" and select the *Menu Item Type* as `Curation Cost Exchange > Profile`. Click `Save`.

### Use
After installation the Cost Comparison Tool will be available under the menu item you have selected. If you are not signed in and click on the menu item you will be presented with a video and a step-by-step tutorial similar to the one available at the [official site](http://www.curationexchange.org/compare-costs?view=comparecosts&layout=tour). Signing-in you will be taken into a workflow to define your organisation, define your costs and compare them with the other organisations available on your instance.

Please note that cost information of othen organisations available on the oficial site will not be available on your instance. Also, the information you provide in your own instance will **not** be shared with the oficial site.

Also, please note that other static information available on the oficial site, like: About, Understand your costs, Read more, and Vendor Services will not be available on your instance.

If your user has the role of "Super User" on Joomla! you will be able to access the Administrator menu, where you can manage the Cost Comparison Tool.

After login you can also access your own profile by clicking the menu item with your user full name.

### Troubleshooting

**Error installing template: Copy failed**<br>
When changing the template via the administrator and then installing a new version of the template the error message `Copy failed` might appear. You will need to undo the changes done to the template or uninstall the previous version of the template prior to installing the new one.
