====

This is the development page of the curationexchange.org platform, specifically the curation cost comparison tool, which allows you to submit and compare your costs with others.

[**www.curationexchange.org**](http://www.curationexchange.org/) is a site that allows you to *understand what you and others are and should be spending in digital curation*.

It is based on [Joomla!](http://www.joomla.org/) and is implemented by a theme and an extension that implements the interactive part of the site, the cost comparison tool.

You can install your own version of the www.curationexchange.org and allow your institution and partners to submit and share curation costs.
